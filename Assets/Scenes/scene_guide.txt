Hello!

This is a guide to navigating the scene maze of this project.


The game starts from MainMenu.

Next scene is either the Lobby_PC or Lobby_VR scene depending on which control mode was chosen.

After lobby, a root game scene is loaded. (Multiplayer, Tutorial, SoloTraining, Exam etc..)
These will contain all the necessary components for that game mode.

Player related scenes (PCPlayer, VRPlayer) will be loaded on top of these root scenes or Lobby scene if in VR.
These contain all the necessary objects for the player of the current control mode.

Environment related scenes will also be loaded additively on top. (Different rooms with problems etc.)
Same rooms should theoretically be able to be used in multiple game modes.

Any extra scenes will be loaded additively on top of the root scenes.
(Postprocessing, AudioManager etc...)


TLDR:

		MainMenu

Lobby_PC 	or 	Lobby_VR
	|				|	----> Load additive (VRPlayer)
	|				|
	v				v
	
	Root Game scenes
			------------> Load additive   	(PCPlayer if no VRPlayer)
			
			------------> Load additive		(Room environment)
	
			------------> Load additive		(Extra utility scenes)
